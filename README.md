# C# TCP chat project

The aim of this project is to expand my C# expertise while also teaching myself about sockets and networking in general. 

It's simplified TCP chat server using synchronous single-threaded code.

This is made with [this tutorial](https://16bpp.net/tutorials/csharp-networking/03a/) as a base.
